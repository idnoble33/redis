# redis
create Restful API with node and Redis
# Approach
After uderstanding the whole project concept
- Install all the dependecies needed such redis, morgan dotenv bcryptjs, @hapi/joi, nodemon
- Design project workflow
- connect the server 
- connect redis
- write restful API for /create and /login
- give security and validation

Note: I used nodemon to avoid going back and forth restating serve
I also left some API blueprint for RESTFUL API that could help in taking security to the next level. Where we could have access token and refresh token. To expire the user login. 
Also once you run npm install and node module is added everything should be good to go
